# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Every word in uppercase represents a field you can supply.<br>
  e.g. in `addc n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter that can be substituted for `John Doe`, as in `addc n/John Doe`.

- Fields contained in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. when provided with the fields `n/NAME [t/TAG]`, you can submit `n/John Doe t/friend` if you want to mark this contact as a `friend`, or `n/John Doe` otherwise.

- Fields with `…`​ after them can be submitted any number of times, including zero.<br>
  e.g. when provided with the field `[t/TAG]…​`, you can leave the field blank, or submit `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`, etc.

- You can submit fields in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, submitting in the format `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`, such as in `p/91472381 n/John Doe`, is also acceptable.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines. This is to avoid deletion of space characters surrounding line-breaks when lengthy text is copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Follow these steps:
1. Install OutBook on the other computer following the same instructions as in the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start). An empty data file will be created in the same folder as the application. 
2. Replace this empty data file with the file that contains the data from your previous OutBook installation.
3. Your transferred data should now be visible upon launching OutBook.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. You can solve this by deleting the `preferences.json` file created by the application, before running the application again.
